The FinTag Public API allows developers to interact with identity and wallet data using a simple, secure public key.

## Base URL
The base URL for all API requests is:

```cURL
https://api.fintag.io/
```


## Authentication
All API requests require an API key for authentication. A **temporary** API key for testing purposes is provided below:


```
fin_test_u2yN9jp1VZzB1TBGSuNiQUGk4AYqy5nc
```

You can now include them in your sdk initialization code.

## Rate Limiting
The FinTag Public API enforces rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain performance. The current default rate limit is 10 requests per minute. If you exceed this limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. To avoid hitting the rate limit, consider implementing exponential backoff or request throttling in your application.

## Error Handling
The FinTag Public API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Common status codes include:
- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or cannot be served. The response will include details about the error.
- `401 Unauthorized`: The API key is missing or invalid.
- `403 Forbidden`: The request is understood, but it has been refused or access is not allowed.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: The rate limit has been exceeded.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server.
In case of an error, the response body will typically contain a JSON object with more details about the error.
